				Over the years technology has been growing exponentially paving ways for tremendous improvement in all the sectors. The value of the growth is felt by all of us in almost all fields. But there are pitfalls in effective utilization of the expertise of the emerging technology.<br><br>
				Understanding the above state of affairs, Kongu Engineering College has been providing various platforms that include organizing conferences, seminars, workshops both national and international level frequently in the emerging areas of technology. In this series evolved the thought process of this International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Communication for Smart World (I2C2SW 2018).<br><br>
				I congratulate and appreciate all the faculties of school of Communication and Computer Sciences in giving emphasis for this scenario.<br><br>
				I am happy that the conference has attracted a good response from India and abroad. I would like to thank the committee members who have spared their valuable time organize the conference successfully.
				I would like to reassure that the management of Kongu Engineering College will continue to provide all the support for fostering such activities.<br><br>
				Let us hope that the conference will open up new vistas of Research and Development.<br><br>
