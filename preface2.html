					I am honored to be part of the event I2C2SW which is held in Kongu Engineering College on December 14th to 15th 2018. This event brings you the collection of 100 novel articles in the area of communication and computing. In addition this event serves as good platform for academic community, industry people for exchange of ideas. <br><br>

					During this meeting, the researchers present most recent discoveries in the area of communication and computing as well as many participants established networks for joint collaborations among the participants. <br><br>

					I wish this volume of papers will be good asset for referring future research works and seed for further enhanced research work. I thank management for encouraging these activities for the benefit of academic community.
